#  Recreational marijuana legalized in Florida!

Florida voters decided on Tuesday, November 8th that recreational marijuana will be legalized in the state. The amendment was added to the ballot by petition and will now allow Floridians over the age of 21 to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants in their homes. The amendment also establishes a regulatory system for marijuana businesses, which will be taxed at 7% on top of the state’s 6% sales tax.

This is a historic moment for Florida, as it becomes one of the first southern states to legalize recreational marijuana. The vote was extremely close, with just 50.1% in favor of legalization. This shows that there is still much work to be done in order to change mindsets about cannabis, but it is a big step in the right direction.

There are many supporters of recreational marijuana legalization who believe that it will help reduce crime rates, increase tax revenue, and create jobs. There are also those who worry about potential health risks; however, so far there is no concrete evidence that shows that marijuana is harmful when used responsibly. In fact, research has shown that marijuana may have some positive health effects, such as reducing pain and inflammation and helping with seizures and other medical conditions.

It will be interesting to see how Florida implements this new law and what effect it has on the state. It is clear that public opinion is changing and more states are moving towards legalization. As cannabis becomes more accepted and mainstream, we can expect to see even more progress made in this area.

#  Pro-marijuana campaigners celebrate as recreational use inches closer to becoming legal 

In a historic vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved a bill to legalize recreational marijuana use. The vote wasCongratulations go out to the pro-marijuana activists who have long fought for legalization, and who are likely rejoicing at this latest development.

It’s unclear exactly when the bill will become law, as it still needs to be passed by the House of Commons and receive royal assent from the Governor General. However, it’s looking increasingly likely that recreational marijuana will be legal in Canada by summer 2018.

This is big news, both for Canada and for the rest of the world. For years, marijuana has been demonized and treated as a dangerous narcotic, despite there being no solid evidence to support this claim. In fact, cannabis has a wide range of potential medical uses, including treating chronic pain, anxiety, and depression.

Legalizing recreational marijuana will help to dispel some of the myths around this plant and its effects. It will also bring in much-needed tax revenue that can be used to fund important social programs. And finally, it will reduce the burden on our justice system, which is currently struggling to deal with all of the marijuana-related arrests.

There are sure to be some bumps in the road as Canada moves towards legalizing recreational marijuana use. But with so many benefits on offer, it’s a change that is long overdue.

#  When will recreational marijuana be legalized in Florida? 

The Sunshine State could be the next to legalize recreational marijuana, following in the footsteps of states like Colorado and California. A recent poll shows that 71% of Floridians support legalizing recreational cannabis.

Florida lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would legalize recreational marijuana. The bill, filed by state Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, would allow adults over the age of 21 to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and grow up to six plants at home.

If the bill is approved, it would likely take effect in 2020. Florida would join 10 other states and Washington, D.C., in legalizing recreational marijuana.

So far, the bill has had mixed reactions from state lawmakers. Some support it, while others are opposed to legalization.

Supporters of the bill argue that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and that legalization would help reduce crime rates and generate revenue for the state. They also say that prohibition has failed and that regulating and taxing marijuana would be a more effective approach.

Opponents of the bill argue that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can lead to addiction and other health problems. They also say that legalization would increase youth access to cannabis and that it would be difficult to enforce properly.

#  Florida Senate pushes to have recreational marijuana legalized by early 2019 

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - The Florida Senate pushed on Tuesday to have the recreational use of marijuana legalized by early 2019, just months before voters could have their say on the issue in a statewide referendum.

The proposed constitutional amendment, which needs the backing of 60 percent of voters to become law, would allow adults aged 21 and over to possess up to 2.5 ounces (71 grams) of cannabis and grow up to six plants at home.

The measure sailed through its first committee stop in the Republican-controlled Senate, winning bipartisan support. But it is unclear if there is enough momentum to get it passed before Floridians go to the polls in November 2020.

Backers of the amendment say it would create a regulated market for cannabis and bring much-needed tax revenue to the state. Opponents argue that it would lead to increased marijuana use among young people and make roadways more dangerous.

"This is about personal freedom," said Democratic Senator Jeff Clemens, one of the amendment's sponsors. "It's about giving adults the right to make their own decisions."

Although marijuana is illegal under federal law, a growing number of U.S. states have moved to legalize it in some form amid shifting public opinion on the drug's risks and benefits. Ten states and Washington D.C., have now legalized recreational marijuana.

In November 2018, Missouri and Utah voted to legalize medical marijuana, while North Dakota voted down a measure that would have done so. Vermont became the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana through legislation in January 2018.

#  Recreational marijuana still a taboo topic in Florida, but attitudes are slowly changing

In Florida, recreational marijuana is still a taboo topic. However, attitudes towards the drug are slowly changing. A recent poll by the University of North Florida found that 58 percent of Floridians support legalizing recreational marijuana.

This is a significant shift from 2014, when only 43 percent of Floridians supported legalization. Back then, the state was still in the grips of prohibitionist policies. But as more and more states have legalized cannabis for recreational use, public opinion has shifted in favor of reform.

Now, even conservative politicians are starting to come around on the issue. Earlier this year, Senator Jeff Brandes introduced a bill that would legalize recreational marijuana in Florida. And in November, voters in Missouri approved a ballot measure to legalize cannabis for recreational use.

So why is recreational marijuana still illegal in Florida?

There are a few reasons. For one, there is significant opposition from law enforcement officials and other prohibitionists. They argue that legalization will lead to increased crime and social ills.

They also claim that marijuana is a “gateway drug” that will lead users to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, studies have shown that cannabis is actually an effective treatment for opioid addiction.

Another reason for opposition is the fact that marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I drug under federal law. This means that it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.

However, there is growing bipartisan support in Congress to reschedule cannabis and allow it to be legally prescribed by doctors. In fact, the House of Representatives just passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which includes provisions to legalize industrial hemp production nationwide.

If Congress were to also pass legislation to legalize recreational marijuana, it would likely override any state laws that prohibit it. This would be a major victory for supporters of cannabis reform, who have been fighting for decades to end prohibition nationwide.
