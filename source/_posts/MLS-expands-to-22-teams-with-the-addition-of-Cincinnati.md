#  MLS expands to 22 teams with the addition of Cincinnati

On Tuesday, Major League Soccer (MLS) announced that Cincinnati would become the league’s 24th team. The new franchise will join the league in 2019 and bring the number of teams up to 22.

“This is a transformational day for our league and for soccer in North America,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. “Cincinnati is an innovative and forward-thinking city with a rich soccer history, and we are very excited to welcome them into the MLS family. They will be a great addition to our Eastern Conference.”

The new team will play its home games at the University of Cincinnati’s Nippert Stadium, which has a capacity of over 35,000 fans. Cincinnati was one of four finalists for the 24th spot, along with Charlotte, Detroit, and Nashville.

In recent years, MLS has been expanding rapidly as it looks to tap into the growing popularity of soccer in the United States. In addition to Cincinnati, six new teams have joined MLS since 2015: Atlanta, Minnesota, Orlando, Portland, Los Angeles FC, and Nashville (which was awarded an expansion team in December 2017).

With the addition of Cincinnati, MLS now has teams in 22 different markets across the United States and Canada. In addition to Nashville, three more expansion teams – Miami, Sacramento, and St. Louis – are currently in the works and are expected to join the league by 2021.

#  LAFC set to debut in March as the newest expansion team

As the 23rd team in Major League Soccer (MLS), Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) is set to debut in March of 2018. The club, which is owned by Hollywood executive and entrepreneur Henry Nguyen, businessman Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and entertainment executive Peter Guber, has already announced its first head coach in Bob Bradley.

Bradley is most notable for his time as head coach of the United States Men's National Team from 2006-2011. He also coached the Egyptian National Team from 2011-2014. Most recently, Bradley was the head coach of Swansea City A.F.C. in the English Premier League.

LAFC has also announced their first two players: Carlos Vela and Diego Rossi. Vela is a Mexican international who has played for Real Sociedad since 2014. Rossi is an Italian-born Uruguayan international who has played for Penarol and Peñarol Montevideo in Uruguay, as well as Fiorentina in Italy.

The club plans to build a 22,000-seat stadium near downtown Los Angeles that will be called Banc of California Stadium. They are also in the process of building a $30 million training facility northeast of downtown L.A..

#  Atlanta United FC makes MLS history with record-breaking attendance numbers

Atlanta United FC set an MLS attendance record in their inaugural season, averaging more than 48,000 fans per game.

The club started strong, drawing over 70,000 fans to their opening game against the New York Red Bulls. They continued to break attendance records throughout the season, culminating in a grand finale at Atlanta’s new Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

More than 71,000 fans watched Atlanta complete their historic season with a victory over the Portland Timbers. The match was also the last of MLS Commissioner Don Garber’s 20-year tenure.

“What an incredible night and what an incredible way to end my time as commissioner of Major League Soccer,” Garber said after the match. “There is no doubt in my mind that this is a soccer city and it’s only going to get bigger and better.”

Atlanta United FC is the latest expansion team to make a big impact in MLS. Other notable teams include Toronto FC, who won the 2017 MLS Cup, and Orlando City SC, who made it to the playoffs in their first two seasons.

As MLS continues to grow in popularity, more and more teams are vying for a spot in the league. Two new teams, Los Angeles FC and Minnesota United FC, will join MLS for the 2018 season.

#  Sounders, Timbers battle it out in MLS Cup final

The 2016 MLS Cup final will be contested by Seattle Sounders and Portland Timbers on December 10th. It will be the second time these two sides have met in the MLS Cup, with the Sounders winning the previous encounter in 2015.

Seattle come into this game as favourites, having enjoyed a stronger season than their rivals. They finished second in the Western Conference, while the Timbers had to settle for fifth place in the East. However, Portland have been in good form in recent weeks and will be hoping to cause an upset on home soil.

The Sounders have been led by attacking duo Nicolas Lodeiro and Clint Dempsey throughout the season. Lodeiro has been particularly impressive, contributing seven goals and 13 assists in just 27 appearances. However, Dempsey has also been crucial for Seattle, scoring eight times and providing six assists.

Portland have relied heavily on captain Diego Valeri this season. The 31-year-old has scored 21 goals and provided 11 assists in 33 games, making him one of the most dangerous attackers in MLS. Fellow attackers Darlington Nagbe and Fanendo Adi have also impressed, scoring a combined total of 24 goals.

This should be a close match between two evenly matched sides. With both teams boasting top quality players, there is sure to be plenty of excitement on offer at Providence Park. Expect a high-scoring affair with Seattle coming out on top to clinch their first MLS Cup title.

#  Montreal Impact win 2nd consecutive Canadian Championship

The Montreal Impact became the first team in Canadian Championship history to win back-to-back titles, with a 4-2 aggregate victory over Toronto FC.

Montreal took an early lead in the first leg at home thanks to a goal from Matteo Mancosu, but TFC equalized shortly before halftime through Jozy Altidore.

In the second leg at BMO Field, it was all Toronto until the 82nd minute, when Ignacio Piatti converted a penalty to give Montreal the lead. Tosaint Ricketts equalized for Toronto in stoppage time, but Montreal held on to win 4-2 on aggregate.

It’s been a momentous few weeks for the Impact, who also made it to the CONCACAF Champions League final last month. They’ll face Liga MX champions Club America in the two-leg final, with the first leg taking place on April 17th at Olympic Stadium in Montreal.
