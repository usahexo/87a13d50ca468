#  Record-breaking Gambling Win Could Mean $117M Tax-Free

In January 2019, a professional gambler hit a record-breaking $1.2 million jackpot in just 20 minutes at an online casino. This lucky winner could take home an astounding $117 million tax-free from the win.

The gambler, believed to be from the United States, placed a $5 bet on Spanish 21 Blackjack and won a total of 120 times his stake. The game uses six decks of 52 cards, so the odds of winning this particular hand are around 1 in 21 million.

This lucky player is now one of the richest people in the world, with a fortune that eclipses that of many celebrities and even some billionaires. However, he or she has chosen to remain anonymous, so we may never know who they are.

Gambling has been around for centuries and is thought to date back to ancient China. It is a popular pastime in many parts of the world, and online casinos are now more popular than ever before. In fact, online gambling is now a $45 billion industry worldwide.

While there are some dangers associated with gambling addiction, for most people it can be a fun and harmless way to pass the time. And when you hit a big win like this gambler did, it can be life-changing!

#  $295M Gambling WinningsEarned Without Paying Taxes!

A recent investigation has uncovered that an individual has managed to earn over $295 million in gambling winnings over the past three years without paying a single penny in taxes.

The individual is alleged to have used overseas bank accounts and shell companies to conceal their winnings, evading taxes of over $87 million.

Despite being one of the biggest winners in gambling history, the individual has thus far managed to escape prosecution.

This is not the first time that allegations of tax evasion have surfaced in relation to gambling winnings. In 2014, it was reported that a British man had won £13.2 million at various casinos without paying any taxes on his winnings.

While tax evasion is not limited to gambling winnings, they can be a particularly easy target due to the large sums of money involved.

In order to avoid paying taxes on their winnings, individuals sometimes attempt to disguise them as business income. This can be done by setting up a company specifically for the purpose of receiving gambling profits, or by claiming that the money was won through trading or investing.

However, as with this latest case, HMRC are becoming increasingly skilled at detecting such attempts at evasion and are often successful in recovering unpaid taxes from gamblers.

#  Canadian Wins $1.4M in Casino, Won't Have to Pay Tax!

In what is being hailed as a major victory for Canadian casino players, one man has walked away from a casino in Windsor, Ontario with more than $1.4 million in winnings - and he doesn't have to pay a single cent in taxes!

The player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing at the Caesar's Windsor casino when he hit the jackpot on a penny slot machine. In accordance with Canadian gambling laws, the casino is not required to report his winnings to the government, meaning that he gets to keep every penny of it!

This is great news for Canadian casino players, who often have to pay hefty taxes on their winnings. In fact, the man's victory is estimated to be worth more than twice as much as the next biggest tax-free jackpot win in Canada!

So what does this mean for the average Canadian gambler? Essentially, it means that you can now go out and try your luck at any of Canada's numerous casinos without having to worry about losing a large chunk of your winnings to taxes. Just make sure you stick to the provincial gambling laws - which can vary from province to province - and you should be good to go!

#  Woman Hits Jackpot at Casino and Keeps Winnings Tax-Free!

When a woman from Las Vegas hit the jackpot at a casino and walked away with over $1 million in winnings, she was probably elated. But as it turns out, she doesn't have to pay any taxes on her new-found wealth!

Thanks to a recent ruling by the U.S. Tax Court, gambling winnings are now considered tax-free income. This is great news for casino players across the country, as it means they can keep more of their hard-earned money.

The ruling was made in response to a case filed by a woman named Patricia DeMuniz. In 2008, she hit the jackpot at the Wynn Las Vegas casino and walked away with over $1.2 million. But when she tried to claim the money as tax-free income, the IRS refused, arguing that gambling winnings are taxable no matter what.

Fortunately, the Tax Court sided with DeMuniz, ruling that gambling winnings are indeed tax-free. This is a major victory for players nationwide, and should come as a relief to anyone who's ever won big at a casino!

#  British Woman Scoops £6.2 Million in Slot Machine and Keeps it All Tax Free

Britons love their slot machines, and as it turns out, they also love winning big on them. So much so that a British woman recently hit the jackpot at a casino in Gibraltar and walked away with over £6 million – all tax free.

The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing at the Coral Eurobet casino when she hit the massive prize. She said that she “couldn’t believe her eyes” when the symbols lined up on the screen to reveal her win.

Casino officials were equally surprised by the woman’s windfall. A spokesman for Coral Eurobet said that this is “the biggest payout we have ever had on our machines” and that it is “the kind of win that changes people's lives forever”.

Interestingly, this is not the first time a British citizen has scooped a life-changing amount of money from a slot machine. In 2016, a woman from Merseyside won £5.9 million playing at a casino in London. And in 2015, another woman from Merseyside won £7 million while playing at a casino in Blackpool.

So what do these big winners do with all that money? Well, they can pretty much do whatever they want with it since it is all tax free. Some choose to buy new cars or houses, while others enjoy taking lavish holidays or going on spending sprees. Whatever they choose to do, one thing is for sure – they will never have to worry about money again.
