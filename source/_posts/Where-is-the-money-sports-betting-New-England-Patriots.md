#  Where is the money sports betting New England Patriots?

The #1 question on the minds of New England Patriots fans across the country is where has all the money gone sports betting? The Pats were favored by 2.5 points in their AFC Championship matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they failed to cover the spread, losing by 10 points. This was their 3rd straight game as a favorite that they failed to cover the spread.

It's not just sports betting experts who are scratching their heads over this recent string of poor performances by the Patriots; even Bill Belichick seems perplexed. After their loss to Jacksonville, he said, "I don't know. I'm not sure. We'll have to take a look at it."

Belichick and his team will certainly have their work cut out for them as they prepare for next week's Super Bowl matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles are 3-point underdogs in that game, but with Tom Brady looking mortal and questions about the New England defense, there is potential for an upset.

If you're looking for some good news about the Patriots, you could point to their experience as underdogs. In both 2014 and 2016, they were underestimated by opponents in the Super Bowl and ended up winning. Nevertheless, sports betting enthusiasts across the country will be keeping a close eye on how things play out next Sunday.

#  Money on the line for Patriots in week one of sports betting 

The New England Patriots kick off their season against the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night, and they are heavy favorites to win. According to Oddschecker, the Patriots are currently favored by seven points, and the over/under is set at 47.5 points.

This game is important for the Patriots for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they need to start the season off with a win. They have failed to reach the Super Bowl in each of the past two seasons, and they will be looking to make a statement in 2018.

Second, this game is important from a betting perspective. The Patriots are one of the most popular teams in the NFL, and they always attract a lot of attention from bettors. A win over the Chiefs would be a big boost for their odds of winning the Super Bowl, and it would also generate a lot of money for bookmakers.

The Chiefs are an interesting team to watch this season. They made some significant improvements in the offseason, and many people believe that they could be contenders in the AFC this year. However, they are going up against a Patriots team that is very tough to beat at home.

If you are looking to place a bet on this game, I would recommend going with the Patriots. They are clearly the better team, and I expect them to win by at least seven points.
