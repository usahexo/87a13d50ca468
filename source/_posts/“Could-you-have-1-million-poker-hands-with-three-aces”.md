#  “Could you have 1 million poker hands with three aces?”

In a game of poker, the probability of being dealt a four of a kind is 1 in 6,275. This means that if you were to play 100 million hands of poker, you would expect to be dealt four aces about 16,000 times.

Now let’s say you want to know the probability of being dealt three aces in one hand. The answer is 1 in 2,598,960. This means that if you were to play 1 million hands of poker, you would expect to be dealt three aces about 389 times.

So could you have 1 million poker hands with three aces? The answer is yes, but it would likely take a very long time to actually get all 1 million hands.

#  “How many different poker hands can you make with three of a kind?”

When it comes to poker, there are a variety of different hands that can be made. With three of a kind, you can make 23 different hands. This includes hands such as three of a kind, three pairs, and a full house.

Of course, the probability of getting any given hand is never 100%, but with some practice and patience you can increase your chances of winning. In fact, there are many different strategies that can be used in order to improve your poker game.

Some players prefer to play tight, which means that they only play high-value hands. Others like to bluff more often, betting big on cards that they believe are good even if they don’t have the best hand. However you choose to play, always remember that poker is all about outsmarting your opponents.

If you’re just starting out with poker, be sure to learn the basic ranking of hands. This will help you determine which hands are worth betting on. The higher the hand rank, the better the hand is. Here is a basic ranking of poker hands:

Royal flush: A straight flush consisting of 10 through Ace
First-class royal flush: A straight flush consisting of Ace through 9 
Four of a kind 
Full house: Three of a kind plus a pair 
Flush: Five cards all of the same suit 
Straight: Five cards in numerical order (not all the same suit) 
Three of a kind 
Two pair 
One pair

#  “Can you make a royal flush with three of a kind?”

The answer to this question is yes, it is possible to make a royal flush with three of a kind. In fact, there are numerous ways to make a royal flush with three of a kind.

Some ways to make a royal flush with three of a kind include:

1. Having three kings and two other cards that are either all hearts or all clubs.

2. With three queens and two other cards that are either all diamonds or all spades.

3. With three jacks and two other cards that are either all hearts or all clubs.

#  “What are the odds of getting three of a kind in poker?”

A few poker players might give you a number like 1 in 6,844,724. That’s the odds of getting three of a kind when you have six cards to choose from. The answer is more complicated than that, of course, because it depends partly on the makeup of the rest of the deck and what your opponents are holding.

To start with, let’s look at the odds of getting three of a kind when you have just one card to choose from. That would be 1 in 4 (or 25 percent), since there are four different suits and only one of each suit can make up a three-of-a-kind.

If you have two cards to choose from, then the odds are 2 in 3 (or 66.7 percent) because there are three different suits and two of each suit would make up a three-of-a-kind.

When you have six cards to choose from, as we mentioned earlier, the odds are 1 in 6,844,724 (or 0.0000015 probability). But that includes all hands with three of a kind—even if some of those hands aren’t very good ones.

In reality, your chances of getting three of a kind are much better if some of your other cards are also suited for that rank. For example, if you have two clubs and two spades out of your six cards, then your odds would be 2 in 13 (or 15.4 percent) because there are only two different suits left (clubs and spades). And if all six cards are suited for that rank, then your odds would be 6 in 13 (or 46.2 percent).

#  “How to make the most of your three-of-a-kind hand in poker.”

When you are playing poker and are dealt three of a kind, there are a few things that you can do in order to make the most of this hand. 

The first and most important thing is to figure out what rank your three of a kind is. This can be done by counting the number of different ranks contained within your hand. In the case of three aces, for example, there is only one rank (A), so your hand would be rank 1. If you have three kings, there are four different ranks (K,Q,J,10), so your hand would be rank 4. 

Once you know the rank of your hand, you can start to think about how to play it. If your hand is rank 1 or 2, you should usually just bet or raise as usual. However, if your hand is rank 3 or higher, you may want to consider trying something more aggressive. One option would be to go all-in with your hand; this will force your opponents to either fold or risk losing a lot of money on a drawing hand. Another option would be to bet/raise heavily preflop in order to scare your opponents away from calling. 

No matter what strategy you choose to use with your three of a kind, remember that this is still a very strong hand and should be played aggressively whenever possible.
