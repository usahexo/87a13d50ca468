#  How is black jack in California different than in Belize?

There are many variances between black jack in California and black jack in Belize. The main difference is that the Belize version is played with a Spanish deck, which has 48 cards instead of 52. This means that there are only four suits (instead of six) and each suit has ten cards instead of twelve. In addition, the face values are different – the ace is worth 1 point, the 2-10 cards are worth face value, and the king, queen, and jack are each worth 10 points.

Another significant difference between the two versions of black jack is how the game is scored. In Belize, when one player reaches 21 points or more than the opponent’s score (whichever is lower), that player wins the game. In California, on the other hand, players can continue playing until one has reached exactly 21 points; this player then wins the game.

Finally, there are some minor differences in terms of betting and gameplay mechanics. For instance, in Belize players can only bet on themselves (and not on others), and if both players have Blackjack when the first card is dealt, the hand is considered a push (i.e., no one wins or loses).
