That said, here are a few things to keep in mind when playing against multiple decks:

-Your chances of winning decrease as more decks are used. This is because there are more cards in the deck that can help the dealer improve their hand.

-The payout for blackjack also decreases as more decks are used. So if you’re betting big bucks, make sure you stick with traditional six-deck games rather than those with eight or more decks.

-You have a better chance of winning when playing against six decks compared to eight or more. But don’t forget that your odds still aren’t great – even when playing against fewer decks. Your best bet is to brush up on the basic strategy and play smart!
