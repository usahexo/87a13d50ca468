#  Roth Changes Roulette Wheel Fortune

The Roth IRA has been a mainstay of retirement savings for more than two decades, but recent changes to the rules governing the account have made it an even more important tool for retirement planning.

The Roth was created in 1997 and allows taxpayers to invest after-tax dollars in the account, which can then grow tax-free. Distributions from the Roth are also tax-free, as long as they are taken after age 59 ½ and the account has been open for at least five years.

In order to make the Roth even more attractive, lawmakers tweaked some of the rules governing the account in 2015. Here are three key changes that investors should be aware of:

1) The income limit on Roth contributions was eliminated. Prior to 2015, investors could only contribute to a Roth if their income fell below a certain threshold. That limit has now been eliminated, making the Roth available to all taxpayers, regardless of their income level.

2) Spousal contributions are now allowed. Married couples can now contribute to a Roth IRA for each other, regardless of whose income is higher. This can be especially helpful for couples in which one spouse doesn’t work or has a lower income.

3) The conversion allowance has been increased. In addition to being able to contribute directly to a Roth IRA, investors can also convert funds from their traditional IRA into a Roth. The amount that can be converted has been increased from $100,000 to $200,000 per individual.

The elimination of the income limit and increased conversion allowance make the Roth even more appealing for taxpayers who want to save for retirement. The account offers a number of advantages over traditional IRAs, including tax-free growth and distributions. For taxpayers who qualify, the Roth is an excellent way to save for a comfortable retirement.

Roth IRA is a great way to save for retirement, and with the recent changes to the
 rules, it’s even more attractive. You can now contribute up to $5,500 per year (indexed for inflation) and your contributions are not taxed when you make them. But what about withdrawals? Are they taxed?

The answer is, it depends. If you withdraw your contributions before 59.5 years old, then you will pay tax on the withdrawal. But if you wait until after 59.5 years old, then your withdrawals will be tax-free. This is a huge advantage over traditional IRA or 401(k) plans, where withdrawals are always taxable.

But what about the profits you make on investments in your Roth IRA? Are they also tax-free? The answer is yes! Any profits you make on investments in your Roth IRA are tax-free, as long as you meet certain conditions: 1) the account has been open for at least five years, and 2) you are at least 59.5 years old when you withdraw the profits.

These tax advantages can add up to big savings over time. For example, if you contribute $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA for 30 years and earn an average annual return of 7%, your account will be worth over $1 million! And because all of the withdrawals and profits from your Roth IRA will be tax-free, that money will be completely yours to use in retirement.

So how do you take advantage of these tax advantages? It’s actually quite simple. Just follow these steps:

1) Open a Roth IRA account with a brokerage firm or mutual fund company. There are many different firms to choose from, so shop around until you find one that fits your needs. 2) Select some investments for your Roth IRA account. You can choose from a wide variety of investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. 3) Invest what you can each month. Ideally, you should contribute as much as possible to get the most out of the tax advantages of a Roth IRA. But even if you can only contribute a little each month, it’s still worth doing! 4) Let time do its thing! Over time, your contributions will grow into a larger nest egg that can provide for a comfortable retirement.

#  Roth Turns Roulette Wheel Upside Down

For the first time in history, the Roth IRA conversion rule is being turned on its head. The change is expected to help millions of Americans, including those who are not currently wealthy enough to take advantage of Roth IRAs.

Up until now, only taxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000 could convert their regular IRAs into Roths. But the new ruling, announced by the Treasury Department on Friday, allows all taxpayers to do so regardless of income.

The move is designed to address the nation's growing wealth inequality. According to a report released last year by the Institute for Policy Studies, the richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 61 percent of the population combined.

"This change will help reduce inequality and provide more retirement security for middle-class families," said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a statement.

Under the new rule, taxpayers will still be able to deduct their traditional IRA contributions from their taxable income, but they will have to pay taxes on any converted funds. This may seem like a disadvantage, but because Roth IRA earnings are tax-free, most people will come out ahead in the long run.

The change goes into effect on January 1st, and taxpayers have until October 15th of next year to make any conversions. So if you're thinking about converting your IRA, now is the time to do it!

#  Roth Tilts the Odds in His Favor with Roulette Strategy

Roth has been playing roulette for years, and he's developed a winning strategy that gives him an edge over the house.

Roth begins by making a simple wager on a black number. If the ball lands on any other number, Roth doesn't lose anything, but if it lands on black, Roth doubles his bet for the next spin.

If Roth wins the next spin, he continues to double his bet until he either loses or hits his target winnings. If Roth loses the next spin, he starts over with a new wager.

This strategy gives Roth a good chance of winning money in the long run, as long as he avoids making too many consecutive losses.
