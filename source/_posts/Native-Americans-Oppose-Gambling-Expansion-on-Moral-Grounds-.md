#  Native Americans Oppose Gambling Expansion on Moral Grounds 

Gambling has been a contentious issue in the United States for many years. While some people see it as a harmless way to pass the time, others believe that it can be addictive and destructive. This conflict is particularly pronounced when it comes to gambling expansion, as those who stand to profit from it often have a different perspective than those who believe that gambling can have negative consequences.

One group that has consistently opposed gambling expansion is Native Americans. This is largely due to the fact that many of them see gambling as morally wrong. They argue that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin, and that it does not reflect their values or culture. As a result, they have been a powerful voice in fighting against expansions of gambling in their states.

Native Americans have had some success in this area, as many states have agreed not to expand gambling without the consent of tribes within those states. This has been an important protection for Native American communities, as they are often among the most adversely affected by gambling addiction and other negative consequences.

While there is still work to be done, Native Americans remain resolute in their opposition to gambling expansion on moral grounds. This is a fight that they are likely to continue for many years to come.

#  State's Native American Tribes Band Together to Oppose Gambling Expansion 

In the early days of the United States, Native American tribes were often at war with one another. A hundred and seventy years later, they are working together to oppose gambling expansion in their states.

Leaders of nine different tribes gathered in Oklahoma on Monday to announce their opposition to a proposed ballot initiative that would allow casinos in four counties north of Tulsa. The measure would have a significant negative impact on the tribes’ gaming operations, which account for a large share of their revenue.

“We don’t want competition,” said Terry Rambler, chairman of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. “We’re united against this. We’re going to do whatever it takes to stop it.”

The tribes collectively earn more than $1 billion annually from casinos, hotels, and other businesses associated with gaming. About half of that comes from operations in Oklahoma.

Opposition to gambling expansion is not new for Native American tribes, but it has typically been focused on protecting tribal sovereignty or preventing new casinos from opening near existing ones. This is the first time that so many tribes have banded together to oppose a specific proposal.

Oklahoma is one of several states where gambling interests are pushing for expanded casino-style gaming. Bills proposing new forms of gambling or increasing the availability of certain games have been introduced in nearly half of all state legislatures this year.

The growth of gambling has generated increased competition among businesses and proposals for new casinos are often popular because they can create jobs and generate tax revenue. But the negative impacts on existing businesses and the potential for addiction and social problems have led some groups to oppose them.

Gambling interests outspent opponents by a ratio of more than 10-to-1 in 2016 state-level races across the country, according to an analysis by The Washington Post . But that may be changing as awareness of the issue increases. In Missouri, a ballot initiative to expand casino gambling was defeated earlier this year after opponents mounted an effective campaign focused on its harmful effects .

Groups opposing gambling expansion will need to raise similar amounts of money if they hope to be successful in future campaigns. Native American tribes may be well positioned to provide some of those funds, as they have done in the past .

#  Another Group Joins List of Critics of Proposed Gambling Expansion 

The possibility of a gambling expansion in the state of Ohio has created a rift among many groups and organizations in the Buckeye state. The newest group to criticize the proposed measure is Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).

In a statement issued by the organization, MADD expressed concern that the proposed gambling expansion would lead to an increase in problem and pathological gambling. This, in turn, would lead to more DUIs and other crimes perpetrated by those with gambling addiction problems.

MADD joins a growing chorus of voices who are calling on lawmakers to reject the proposed gambling expansion. These voices include church groups, anti-gambling advocates, and businesses who stand to lose money if expanded gambling is approved.

Despite this opposition, it appears that lawmakers are still poised to move ahead with the measure. This has led some people to question whether or not special interests are behind the push for expanded gambling.

#  Native American Group Adds Its Voice to Opposition of Gambling Expansion 

The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians has announced its opposition to a proposed expansion of gambling in Michigan, warning that the move could harm the state's tribes and businesses.

In a statement, the tribe said that it was "deeply troubled" by the proposal, which would allow for new casinos to be built in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Lansing.

"This is bad policy for Michigan," said tribe chairmanperson Dave Yankee. "It will hurt our tribal businesses and those of our neighbors, as well as the state's economy."

The Pokagon Band joins a growing chorus of voices opposing the gambling expansion, which has been championed by Governor Rick Snyder. In addition to the tribes, several business groups have spoken out against the proposal, warning that it could lead to job losses and bankruptcies.

Despite the opposition, Governor Snyder remains committed to the expansion, arguing that it will create new jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. He is expected to submit a final proposal to lawmakers later this month.

#  Another Tribe Comes Out Against Proposed Gambling Expansion

In what is becoming an increasingly common refrain, another tribe has now come out against proposed gambling expansion in their state. This time, it's the Mohican Tribe in Ohio, which says that the expanded gambling would violate their rights and threaten their sovereignty.

The Mohicans are the latest in a line of tribes to speak out against gambling expansion proposals across the country. Just last month, the Seminole Tribe of Florida filed a lawsuit against the state over a gambling bill that would have allowed for more casinos. The tribe argued that the bill violated a 2010 agreement between the state and the tribe that gave the Seminoles exclusive rights to operate casinos in Florida.

Other tribes around the country have also voiced opposition to gambling expansion proposals. In California, for example, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians said that a proposed expansion would create too much competition for them and threaten their business model. In Connecticut, both the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Tribes have spoken out against a proposal to expand casino gaming in the state.

What's behind this wave of tribal opposition to gambling expansion? One key factor is undoubtedly money. Tribes rely on casino gaming revenue to support important social services and cultural programs, so any threat to that revenue stream is sure to be met with resistance.

But there's more to it than just money. Tribes see themselves as stewards of ancestral lands and cultures, and they take their role seriously. They see gambling expansion as a threat not just to their financial security but also to their way of life.

For these reasons, tribes are likely to continue opposing gambling expansions across the country. Their voices deserve to be heard, and we should pay attention to what they have to say
