#  Cost of building encore casino revealed!

The much anticipated encore casino is set to open very soon, and while some excitement is brewing among the general public, there are also a lot of naysayers who feel that this new resort is going to be a big flop.

One of the main reasons for this is because of the cost associated with building it. It is said that the project has cost over $2.5 billion, making it one of the most expensive casino resorts in history.

There are a lot of people who are questioning why such a large amount of money was spent on something that may not generate enough revenue to cover the costs. In fact, some analysts are predicting that the encore casino may not even break even in its first year of operation!

While it's hard to know for sure how things will play out, it's clear that the encore casino is facing some pretty big challenges. Not only does it have to compete with other casinos in town, but it's also dealing with increased taxes and regulation from the government.

This all means that it will be interesting to see how things play out in the months and years ahead. If you're interested in gambling or just want to check out what all the fuss is about, then be sure to head down to the encore casino when it opens!

#  $700 million price tag shocks many!

$700 million is a lot of money. Especially for something that doesn't have any use. That's right, I'm talking about the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook. How could something that doesn't make any money be worth so much?

It's not as if Facebook is hurting for cash. The company has plenty of money to spend. In fact, the purchase of WhatsApp is one of the most expensive acquisitions in history. So what is behind this deal?

Some people are speculating that Facebook is interested in WhatsApp because of its large user base. The app has over 450 million users, which is a lot more than other messaging apps like Kik or Snapchat. Facebook could potentially use this user base to expand its own business.

Others believe that Facebook is simply trying to keep up with Google, which recently acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Google seems to be interested in the "internet of things" and home automation, and WhatsApp could be a part of that strategy.

Whatever the reason, there's no doubt that Facebook paid a lot for WhatsApp. And many people are wondering if it was worth it.

#  How much did it really cost to build the encore?

The encore, which is the new home of the detroit Red Wings, cost an estimated $862 million to build. This price tag makes it the most expensive arena in the NHL. The original estimate was that the encore would cost around $450 million to build, but the final price was more than double that amount.

There are several reasons for this increase in price. For starters, the encore is a much larger arena than the one it replaced. It also has more features, such as a practice rink and a glass-walled club seating area. Additionally, construction costs have been on the rise in recent years.

Despite its high cost, many people believe that the encore was worth it. The new arena has already had a major impact on Detroit’s economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating millions of dollars in revenue. It has also helped to revitalize downtown Detroit, which is great news for the city’s residents and businesses.

So far, the encore has been a big success and there’s no doubt that it will continue to bring value to Detroit for many years to come.

#  $525 million in taxpayer money spent on encore casino

On July 26, 2018, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) announced that the $2.6 billion Encore Boston Harbor casino has been completed. The casino is the most expensive and largest in Massachusetts, with 33 floors and a gaming floor of 200,000 square feet.

$525 million of the cost was funded by taxpayers, through a state-issued bond. The rest of the cost was funded privately by Everett Resorts LLC, which is owned by billionaire Stephen Wynn. Mr. Wynn is currently facing multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment. In February 2018, he resigned as chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts Ltd., although he retains a major ownership stake in the company.

The MGC has defended its decision to fund the casino with taxpayer money, despite the allegations against Mr. Wynn. Critics argue that the money could have been better spent on other priorities, such as education or infrastructure projects.

The Encore Boston Harbor is expected to create 6,500 jobs and generate $277 million in annual tax revenue for Massachusetts.
