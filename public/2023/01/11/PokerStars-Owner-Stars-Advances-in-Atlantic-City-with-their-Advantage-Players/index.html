Their purchase of the Atlantic Club casino in Atlantic City was a sign that they are looking to expand their gambling empire.</p>
<p>Their purchase of the Atlantic Club casino in Atlantic City was a sign that they are looking to expand their gambling empire. And this week they made a big move, obtaining approval to open up their own poker room inside of the casino. This will give them an advantage over other poker rooms in town, as they will have exclusive access to the high-rollers who visit the casino.</p>
<p>The approval came after a long legal battle with New Jersey regulators, who initially refused to give them the green light. But the Scheinbergs prevailed, and now have a clear path to expanding their business in one of the country’s most important gambling markets.</p>
<p>This is just the latest move by the Scheinbergs as they look to build an international gambling empire. They have been busy building PokerStars into one of the world’s largest online poker networks, and now appear ready to make a bigger push into live casinos.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Club acquisition was just one part of a larger strategy by PokerStars. They have also been buying up smaller casinos all over Europe, in an effort to build a global network of properties that can offer their games.</p>
<p>The Scheinbergs clearly see opportunity in the burgeoning online gambling market, and are making aggressive moves to be at the forefront of it. With PokerStars already firmly established as one of the top brands in online poker, they appear poised for even more success in 2013 and beyond.</p>

PokerStars pro Mike Sexton offers the following tips on how to be a successful advantage player:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know your opponents: This is perhaps the most important piece of advice. If you know who your opponents are and what they’re capable of, you can make better decisions about how to play against them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid to fold: This may seem counterintuitive, but if you’re not confident in your hand, it’s better to fold than risk losing more money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined: One of the keys to being a good advantage player is staying disciplined – knowing when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient: It’s important not to get impatient and start playing recklessly. Wait for the right hand before putting your money in play.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know the game inside out: The more you know about the game, the better equipped you’ll be to take advantage of your opponents. Study different strategies and learn as much as you can about the nuances of the game.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="PokerStars-Owner-Fish-Reveal-Secrets-To-Winning-At-Advantage-Play"><a href="#PokerStars-Owner-Fish-Reveal-Secrets-To-Winning-At-Advantage-Play" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Owner Fish Reveal Secrets To Winning At Advantage Play"></a>PokerStars Owner Fish Reveal Secrets To Winning At Advantage Play</h1><p>If you’re looking to increase your poker earnings, you need to start taking advantage of the fish at the table. Fortunately, we got a chance to chat with some of the top minds in poker who shared their secrets on how to win at advantage play.</p>
<p>According to world-renowned poker pro and author, Bill Chen, “The best way to make money playing poker is by exploiting bad players. So, if you can find tables that are full of weaker opponents, you’ll be able to make more money in the long run.”</p>
<p>To beat the fish, Chen recommends using a loose-passive strategy. This involves playing a lot of hands (loose), betting and raising only when you have a good hand (passive), and letting your opponents do most of the heavy lifting (playing scared). When used correctly, this style can be extremely profitable against bad players.</p>
<p>Another top pro with plenty of experience beating fish is John Juanda. According to Juanda, the key to winning at advantage play is identifying the weak players at the table and attacking them relentlessly. “The biggest mistake most players make is that they try and take down every pot they can. This isn’t necessary against bad players. Instead, just focus on putting pressure on them and making them uncomfortable. If you do this consistently, they will eventually make mistakes that you can capitalize on.”</p>
<p>Finally, we spoke with PokerStars owner Isai Scheinberg who shared some valuable insights into beating fish. According to Scheinberg, one of the most important things to remember is that fish are emotional players who often make irrational decisions based on their feelings rather than logic. “You need to be prepared for this by having a solid game plan in place that takes these emotions into account. If you can figure out what makes the fish tick, you’ll be able to take them down much more easily.”</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Leads-The-Way-In-Advantage-Play"><a href="#PokerStars-Leads-The-Way-In-Advantage-Play" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Leads The Way In Advantage Play"></a>PokerStars Leads The Way In Advantage Play</h1><p>The world of professional poker is one that is constantly evolving, with new strategies and techniques being developed all the time. While the poker world is full of players who are looking to gain any edge they can, few players have taken advantage playing as effectively as PokerStars has.</p>
<p>Led by top pros like Daniel Negreanu and Liv Boeree, PokerStars has been a pioneer in the field of advantage play. Taking advantage of small edges in the game can add up to big profits over time, and PokerStars has consistently been on the forefront of finding these edges.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms of advantage play in poker is multi-level thinking. This involves looking at each hand not just in terms of what cards are being played, but also what the potential outcomes could be. For example, a player might raise preflop with pocket aces to try and take down the pot right there. However, if they know their opponent is likely to fold if they reraise, then they could potentially make more money by slowplaying their aces and waiting for a better spot.</p>
<p>PokerStars has been particularly effective in using multi-level thinking to win pots. By understanding how their opponents are likely to react in different situations, they can put themselves in position to make money even when they don’t have the best hand. This puts them at a significant advantage over their opponents, who may not be as well-versed in multi-level thinking.</p>
<p>In addition to their mastery of multi-level thinking, PokerStars has also been successful in using deception to gain an edge. By making bets or raises that seem unreasonable or out of line with the situation, they can often get their opponents to fold hands that would otherwise have beaten them. This is known as bluffing, and it’s one of the most important elements of poker strategy.</p>
<p>Bluffing can be a very risky proposition, but if it’s done correctly it can be highly profitable. PokerStars has shown itself to be one of the best at bluffing, which gives them another tool in their arsenal when competing against other professionals.</p>
<p>Overall, PokerStars has proven itself to be one of the top players when it comes to advantage play. Their combination of skills and techniques allows them to win more pots than their opponents, which gives them a significant edge when competing at the highest levels of poker.</p>
